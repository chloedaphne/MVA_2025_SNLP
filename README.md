## Course materials

### Course Objectives

Speech and natural language processing is a subfield of artificial intelligence used in an increasing number of applications. This course will provide an overview and details of techniques and tasks used in the automatic processing of text and speech, covering certain history aspects of the field, the representation of textual and speech data, language modelling, machine translation, sentiment analysis and other labelling tasks, chatbots and speech synthesis and recognition. The aim is to provide the key principles, algorithms and mathematical principles behind the state of the art, and confronting them with the reality of processing real data. 

Topics:

- speech features & signal processing
- hidden markov & finite state modeling
- word embeddings
- deep learning for NLP (RNNs, transformers)
- neural language modelling, including large language models (LLMs)
- machine translation
- sentiment analysis
- sequence labelling tasks
- chatbots
- evaluation: comparing human and machine performance
- speech synthesis and speech recognition
- code generation and agents


## Prerequisites

Basic linear algebra, calculus, probability theory, basic machine/deep learning

## Organisation

### 10 classes

The courses consist of 10 three-hours slots. This year, the course will take place in person, on Thursdays, from 2pm to 5pm, at the Ecole Normale Supérieure, (45 rue d'ULM) or UPCité.

Each three-hour slot will have a lecture lasting approximately two hours, followed by a quiz and Q&As.

### Evaluation

Evaluation consists of 2 parts:
- **Quizzes** (40% of the total grade): You'll be given a link to an online questionnaire (google form) and will have 30 minutes to complete the questionnaire, which will be activated exactly at 6:00pm and closed down at a time decided on-the-fly by the professors, generally 6:30pm. Any forms submitted after the deadline will be automatically rejected and graded as zero. The quizzes will contain comprehension questions and the best 5 grades out of the 6 quizzes will be used for the average. Between 6:30 and 7:00 there will be a Q&A period where you'll be able to ask questions about the course and quiz.
- **Project** (60% of the total grade): You'll work in small groups of 2-4 around a recent paper in speech or language processing which has already some existing code. Your task will be 1. to replicate the main result of the paper 2. run an experiment testing a new question not tested in the paper (propose another approach/improvement on the task, or make the method work on another task or another dataset). You'll present your plan in a one page document for 14 February (specify what you want to do, the planning, and how you will collaborate within the group), and your results in a 4 pages document (deadline: 30 March) and 10 minutes oral presentation + 5 minutes questions between 31 March et du 7 April .

### Q&A

_What happens if I get less than 10/20 on average? Can I take another exam?_

Any obtained grade is final, so there is no possibility of resitting the exam.

_What happens if i cannot be present to the course, and therefore cannot do the online quiz?_

Failure to submit the quiz on time will result in a mark of 0/20 for that quiz, unless you can demonstrate that it was materially impossible for you to be present to the course. Such documented requestes should be sent to mva.speech.language@gmail.com together with the name and date of the missed quiz. The best 5 grades out of the 6 quizzes will be used for the average, giving you the possibility of skipping one quiz.
