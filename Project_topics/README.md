Words often have multiple meanings, and some are used more frequently than others (e.g., the noun _duck_ typically refers to an animal but it is also a cricket term). This paper introduces a simple method to investigate how well the BERT model captures less common word meanings.

Despite the success of large vision and language models (VLMs) in many downstream applications, it is unclear how well they encode the compositional relationships between objects and attributes. This paper introduces a simple training method to overcome the shortcomings of VLMs when it comes to embed this compositional relationship.
